pip install pyap
Step 2: Importing the Library After installing pyap, import it into your Python script:

import pyap
Step 3: Parsing an Address Now, letâ€™s define an address string and parse it using pyap:

address_string = "123 Main Street, San Francisco, CA 94101, United States"
address_parser = pyap.parse(address_string) 

# Extracting parsed address components
parsed_address = address_parser[0]
street = parsed_address.street_number + " " + parsed_address.street_name
city = parsed_address.city
state = parsed_address.region
postal_code = parsed_address.zipcode
country = parsed_address.country

# Printing the extracted components
print("Street:", street)
print("City:", city)
print("State:", state)
print("Postal Code:", postal_code)
print("Country:", country)
Output:

Street: 123 Main Street
City: San Francisco
State: CA
Postal Code: 94101
Country: United States
